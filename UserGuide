Comprehensive User Guide and Setup Instructions for Password Policy Enforcement Script

1. Overview
This guide explains how to set up and use a Python script that enforces a custom password policy. The script prompts users to define requirements such as minimum length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters), and validates entered passwords against these set of rules.

2. Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the script:
•	Python Installation: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
•	Download the Script: Save the script content into a .py file on your local machine; for example, save it as password_policy.py.
•	Dependencies: The script uses Python's built-in modules (random and string), so no additional installations are necessary.

3. Running the Script
Here’s how to execute the script:
•	Open Terminal/Command Prompt:
o	Windows: Use Command Prompt.
o	macOS/Linux: Use Terminal.
•	Navigate to Script Directory: Use the cd command to go to the directory where password_policy.py is located:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/script/directory
•	Execute the Script: Run the script by entering:
Copy code
python password_policy.py

4. Setting Password Policy
When you run the script, it guides you through setting up the password policy:
•	Uppercase Characters: Enter the minimum required number of uppercase letters.
•	Lowercase Characters: Enter the minimum required number of lowercase letters.
•	Digits: Enter the minimum required number of digits.
•	Special Characters: Define the minimum number required and specify allowed characters or use the default set.
Example Setup:
scss
Copy code
At least how many uppercase characters should your password contain? 1
At least how many lowercase characters should your password contain? 2
At least how many digits should your password contain? 2
At least how many special characters should your password contain? 1
Enter the special characters allowed. Leave blank for default special characters. (Default is !#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~"): @!_
Enter the minimum length for the password: 8
Enter the maximum length for the password: 20

5. Testing Password Strength
Once policy setup is complete, test passwords to ensure compliance:
•	Enter Password: Input a password when prompted.
•	Validation: The script checks if the password meets all criteria.
•	Compliance Message: If compliant, a success message is displayed; otherwise, it will suggest a compliant password you may use instead.
Example Usage:
bash
Copy code
Enter your password: MyP@ssw0rd
Your password meets the requirements!

Do you want to test another password? (yes/no): yes
Enter your password: WeakPassword
Password must contain at least 1 uppercase and 2 lowercase characters, 2 digits, and 1 special character. Suggested password: gD6oHv#8L

Do you want to test another password? (yes/no): no

6. Ending the Script
•	Completion: Type no when asked to continue testing passwords to finish the script.
•	Exit: Close the terminal/command prompt window.

7. Customization
•	Modify Default Characters: You can adjust the default special characters set (!#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~"`) or other parameters directly within the script.

8. Additional Notes
•	Security: Ensure scripts are executed in a secure environment.
•	Policy Adjustments: Regularly update policy criteria based on evolving security needs.
Conclusion

By following these detailed instructions, you can effectively implement and manage password policies using the provided Python script. This ensures strong password security aligned with organizational or personal requirements. Adjust policies as needed for enhanced security measures.
