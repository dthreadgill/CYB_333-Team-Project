# Password Policy Enforcement Script

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up and use a Python script that enforces a custom password policy. The script prompts users to define requirements such as minimum length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters), and validates entered passwords against these rules.

## Setup Instructions

### Python Installation

Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Download the Script

Save the script content into a `.py` file on your local machine; for example, save it as `password_policy.py`.

### Dependencies

The script uses Python's built-in modules (`random` and `string`), so no additional installations are necessary.

## Running the Script

### Open Terminal/Command Prompt

- **Windows**: Use Command Prompt.
- **macOS/Linux**: Use Terminal.

### Navigate to Script Directory

Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where `password_policy.py` is located:

```bash
cd path/to/your/script/directory

python password_policy.py
